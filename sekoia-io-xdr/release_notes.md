#### What's Improved

- Added 'Updated Start Date', 'Updated End Date', 'Records Offset' and 'Records Per Page' in 'List Alerts' operation.
- Added the ability to configure data ingestion (using the Data Ingestion Wizard). The Data Ingestion Wizard also
  supports multiple configurations specified on the Configurations tab of the SEKOIA.IO XDR connector, ensuring
  respective global variables based on the selected configuration are used while ingesting data.
